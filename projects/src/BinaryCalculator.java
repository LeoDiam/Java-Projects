//A. (4 units) Implement a program that requests 2 numbers in the binary system (unlabeled integers)
//        and stores them in integer variables.
//        Check that any number given is in the binary system (their digits are O or 1)
//        and if not ask for it again until a correct value is given. The program will then calculate and print their sum.
//        Finally, it will convert the sum to the decimal system and print it again.
